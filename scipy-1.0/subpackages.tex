The SciPy library is organized as a collection of subpackages.  The 16
subpackages include mathematical building blocks (e.g. linear algebra, Fourier
transforms, special functions), data structures (e.g. sparse matrices, $k$-D trees),
algorithms (e.g. numerical optimization and integration, clustering, interpolation,
graph algorithms, computational geometry), and higher-level data analysis
functionality (e.g. signal and image processing, statistical methods).

Here we summarize the scope and capabilities of each subpackage.
Additional information is available in the SciPy Tutorial\cite{SciPy_tutorials} and
API Reference\cite{SciPy_API}.

    elementary functions of a matrix, such as the trace, determinant, norm and

    functions.
\item[\texttt{misc}]
    A collection of functions that did not fit into the other subpackages.
    While this subpackage still exists in SciPy 1.0, effort is underway
    to deprecate or relocate the contents of this subpackage and remove it.
\item[\texttt{odr}]
    Orthogonal distance regression, including Python wrappers for the Fortran
    library ODRPACK\cite{ODRPACK_Boggs}.
\item[\texttt{optimize}]
		This subpackage includes simplex and interior-point linear programming
		solvers, implementations of many nonlinear minimization algorithms,
		a routine for least-squares curve fitting, and 
		a collection of general nonlinear solvers for root-finding.
\item[\texttt{signal}]
    The \texttt{signal} subpackage focuses on signal processing and
    basic linear systems theory.  Functionality includes
    convolution and correlation, splines, filtering and filter design,
    continuous and discrete time linear systems, waveform generation,
    window functions, wavelet computations, peak finding, and spectral
    analysis.  
\item[\texttt{sparse}]
    This subpackage includes implementations of several representations of
    sparse matrices.\newline % \texttt{scipy.sparse.linalg} extends past margin
		\texttt{scipy.sparse.linalg} provides a collection of linear algebra routines that work with
		sparse matrices, including linear equation solvers, eigenvalue decomposition, singular value
		decomposition and LU factorization.
    \texttt{scipy.sparse.csgraph} provides a collections of graph algorithms
    for which the graph is represented using a sparse matrix.  Algorithms
    include connected components, shortest path, minimum spanning tree
    and more.
\item[\texttt{spatial}]
    This subpackage provides spatial data structures and algorithms,
    including the $k$-d tree, Delaunay triangulation, convex hulls and Voronoi
    diagrams. \texttt{scipy.spatial.distance} provides
    a large collection of distance functions, along with functions for
    computing the distance between all pairs of vectors in a given collection
    of points or between all pairs from two collections of points.
\item[\texttt{special}]
    The name comes from the class of functions traditionally known as ``special
    functions'', but over time, the subpackage has grown to include functions
    beyond the classical special functions.  A more appropriate characterization
    of this subpackage is simply ``useful functions''.
    It includes a large collection of the classical special functions
    such as Airy, Bessel, etc.; families of orthogonal polynomials;
    the Gamma function, and functions related to it;
    functions for computing the PDF, CDF and quantile function for several
    probability distributions;
    information theory functions;
    combinatorial functions \texttt{comb} and \texttt{factorial};
    and more.
\item[\texttt{stats}]
    The \texttt{stats} subpackage provides a large collection of continuous
    and discrete probability distributions, each with methods to compute
    the PDF or PMF, CDF, moments and other statistics, generation of random
    variates, and more;
    statistical tests, including tests on equality of means/medians/variance
    (such as the t-test) and tests whether a sample is drawn from a
    certain distribution (such as the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test);
    measures of correlation, including Pearson's $r$, Kendall's $\tau$, and
    Spearman's $\rho$ coefficients;
    descriptive statistics including trimmed values;
    kernel density estimation;
    and transformations of data such as the Box-Cox power transformation.
